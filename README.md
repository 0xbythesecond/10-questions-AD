# 10 Related to Active Directory

`What is Active Directory?`
<br />
Active Directory is a Microsoft service used to manage and store information about resources such as computers, servers, printers, users, and groups on a network. It provides a centralized location for managing and maintaining network resources and allows administrators to control access to these resources.

`What is the purpose of Active Directory?`
<br />
The purpose of Active Directory is to provide a centralized location for managing and maintaining network resources such as computers, servers, printers, users, and groups. It allows administrators to control access to these resources and provides a standardized way to manage user and computer accounts, which reduces the time and effort required to maintain a network.

`What is a domain in Active Directory?`
<br />
A domain is a logical grouping of computers, servers, users, and resources in Active Directory. It provides a hierarchical structure that allows administrators to manage and control access to resources within the domain. Domains are typically used to group resources based on geographical location or business function.

`What is a forest in Active Directory?`
<br />
A forest is a collection of one or more domains that share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog in Active Directory. It allows administrators to manage and control access to resources across multiple domains, and it provides a standardized way to manage user and computer accounts across the organization.

`What is a domain controller in Active Directory?`
<br />
A domain controller is a server that is responsible for authenticating users, storing user account information, and enforcing security policies in a domain in Active Directory. It is a critical component of the Active Directory infrastructure and provides the backbone for managing and maintaining network resources.

`What is the difference between a domain and a workgroup?`
<br />
A domain is a logical grouping of resources in Active Directory that provides centralized management and control of resources. A workgroup is a collection of computers that are not part of a domain and are typically used in small environments with few users and resources. In a workgroup, each computer is responsible for managing its own resources and user accounts.

`What is the Global Catalog in Active Directory?`
<br />
The Global Catalog is a special type of domain controller in Active Directory that stores a subset of the directory data for all domains in a forest. It provides a searchable index of all the objects in the forest, making it possible to find and access resources across domains.

`What is an organizational unit (OU) in Active Directory?`
<br />
An organizational unit (OU) is a container object in Active Directory that is used to group and organize resources such as computers, users, and other OUs. It provides a way to apply security policies and manage resources in a hierarchical manner, allowing administrators to delegate control of resources to specific individuals or groups.

`What are Active Directory sites and what is their purpose?`
<br />
Active Directory sites are logical groupings of computers and other resources in a network that are located in the same geographical area and connected by a high-speed network connection. Sites are used to manage network traffic and optimize network performance by directing users and computers to the closest available domain controller.

`What is Group Policy in Active Directory and what is it used for?`
<br />
Group Policy is a feature of Active Directory that allows administrators to manage and configure user and computer settings on a network. It provides a way to enforce security policies, configure network settings, and control user and computer behavior across the organization. Group Policy settings can be applied to individual users, groups, or computers and can be used to manage a wide range of system and application settings.
